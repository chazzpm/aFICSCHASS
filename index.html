A site built with [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages) and created at alter Nature Technologies aNT. 

An start-up promoted by Charles R Paez to create technologies based on high tech and scientific knowledge with the mindset of 
data sciences, networks, **complex hierarchy adaptive social systems CHASS** and machine learning ML.

develop an evolve, at **Academia Emeritense FC**, our aFICS talents, aFICS head coaches and aFICS teams.

Our current object of study and apply this *alter view of the football game based on this aFICS and CHASS perspectives*.

to apply the outcomes of research.

An opportunity to explore my perspective and reflection about *how is that we can all live in the same Football Universe yet 
see reality so differently*. *I will adopt science’s mindset to walk through in this phenomena of aFICS football*.
