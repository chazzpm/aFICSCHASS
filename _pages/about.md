They, the idols of football, know that we known, time ago, they lie and their metaphor is obsolete. **Football is not a battle** and exploit tasks of attack and defence are not the way to play the sport. We have been exploring other perspective for us.

In aNT, the sport of **football** is used as a *toy world* study case in order to create an *alter vision of the game* for Academia Emeritense FC at Merida, Venezuela. The development of our talents, head coaches and teams are immerse in a *culture of robustness, innovation and adaptation to disrupt* the game guided by the latest *science based mindset* of a **process perspective**. 

I pursue an **organic football universe** understanding from this alter perspective of **coexistence of simplicity and complex abundance of pattern features** in the sport. A shift from what we know to what we do not know by posing new questions pertinents to this process perspective in order to better understanting and style of playing football.

The **environment-game social system**, where football universe deploys, must be studied as a 'whole'; in the largest scale where the most relevant information are those sources of 'diversity and complexity' of affordances, speed in taking decisions, and intentional skills transformed in actions that a footballer must deal and build inside the pitch. All them can be identified in the cognitive, intelligent and synergestic dimensions. So, my perspective can be called an **aFICS vision** of the sport.

Science is done in order to build a **model of the world**. The *source of fluctuations* or **uncertainty** created by ball and pitch dynamics and control during the **game**, that is just **a contest of two team's proposals**, needs to be understood as the *emergence and formation of patterns* as outputs of a proactive -incremental progress- **CHASS model**.

My intention is to affect the efforts in Academia Emeritense FC AcEmFC to *develop our aFICS talents, aFICS head coaches and the aFICS team identity* and *aFICS playing style* the *robust organic football under uncertainty and diversity* that we foresee will dominate in the adjacency future of the sport.
