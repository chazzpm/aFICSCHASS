*They*, the idols of football, *know that we know*, time ago, *they lie* and their metaphor is obsolete and just a valid perspective. **Football is not a battle** and 'exploit' tasks of attack and defense are not the way to play the sport. We had been opted for 'explore' other perspective for us. The reason our **AcEmFC teams plays an alter-football**, consistently during a game and a tournament.

In aNT, the sport of **football** is used as a *toy world* study case in order to create an *alter vision of the game* for Academia Emeritense FC at Merida, Venezuela. The development of our talents, head coaches and teams are immerse in a *culture of robustness, innovation and adaptation to disrupt* the game guided by the latest *science based mindset* of a **process perspective** to explain the pitch and an **synergestic agential perspective** to explain the dialectical behavior of players.

I pursue an **organismic football universe** understanding from this alter perspectives of **coexistence of simplicity and complex abundance of pattern features** in the sport. A shift from what we know to what we do not know by posing new questions pertinents to this process and synergestic agential perspectives in order to 'get things right'. 

Get a better understanding that can exhibit a **causal-mechanismic explanation and management of an effective style of playing football**. Our well posed questions about autonomy and agency in an **alter-football** that pursue to explain **why and how come everything flows everywhere on the pitch**.

The **environment-AcEm's team** social system, where football universe deploys, must be studied as a '**whole**'. First of all, the pitch must be a bounded territory patched by AcEMFC's HC. The system must be described in the largest scale where the most relevant information are those sources of 'fluctuations, diversity and complexity' of affordances, speed in taking decisions, and intentional skills transformed in *autonomic actions* that a footballer must choose and execute inside the pitch.  All them can be identified in the *cognitive, intelligent and synergestic* dimensions. So, my perspective can be called an **aFICS vision of autonomy and agency of synergons** of the sport.

Science is done in order to build a **model of the world**. The *source of fluctuations* and *uncertainty* created by ball and pitch dynamics and control during the **game**; that is just **a contest of two team's play proposals**, needs to be understood as the *emergence and formation of patterns* based on low frequency **synergestic dynamical modules interactions** as outputs of a proactive -incremental progress- **CHASS complex hierarchical adaptive social system** *model*.

My intention is to affect the efforts in Academia Emeritense FC AcEmFC to *develop our aFICS talents, aFICS head coaches, the aFICS team identity* and *aFICSCHASS playing style* as a **robust organismic football under uncertainty and diversity** that we foresee will dominate in the adjacency future of the sport.
