In aNT, the sport of **football** is used as *toy world* study case in order to create an *alter vision of the game* for Academia Emeritense FC at Merida, Venezuela. The development of our talents, head coaches and teams are immerse in a *culture of innovation and adaptation to disruption* guided by a *science based mindset*. 

I pursue an **organic football universe** understanding from this alter perspective of **coexistence of simplicity and abundance [Weingberg] of pattern features** in the sport .

The **environment-game social system**, where football universe deploys, must be studied as a 'whole'; in the largest scale where the most relevant information are those sources of 'diversity and complexity' of affordances, speed in taking decisions, and intentional skills a footballer must deal and build inside the pitch. All them can be identified in the cognitive, intelligent and synergestic dimensions. So, my perspective can be called an **aFICS vision** of the sport.

Science is done in order to build a **model of the world**. The *source of fluctuations* or **uncertainty** created by ball and pitch dynamics and control during the **game**, that is just *a contest of two team's proposals*, needs to be understood as the *emergence and formation of patterns* as outputs of a proactive -incremental progress- **CHASS model**.

My intention is to affect the efforts in Academia Emeritense FC AcEmFC to *develop our aFICS talents, aFICS head coaches and the aFICS team identity* and *aFICS playing style* the *organic football* that we foresee will dominate in the adjacency future of the sport.
