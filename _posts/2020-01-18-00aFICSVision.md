Football has been my toy world. Many of you use to say 'football is life-like.' Football will be my study case for machine
learning ML and for institutional drive at Academia Emeritense FC.

## 0.1. A Culture of Innovation and Disruption
This blog is an effort to build a *culture of innovations and disruptions* [vmware-2018] based on a reflection about the
**mindset of science in football** with **machine learning ML data science** efforts and discipline to achieve:

    - Paternships building an ecosystem focused on our costumers (talents, families, teams, tournaments, leagues) 
    by connecting all of them through a new language game and by turning disruption into opportunities to innovate
    in football together.
    - Drive our efforts by innovating with purpose toward a self-actualization of the aFICS vision
    - Resilience for our aFICS vision by embracing change and diversity to drive innovation in order to create an 
    organization capable to react to an onslaught challenges and coming out even stronger and robust. 
    - Foster diversity, in a culture of innovations that has to be pervasive across everything we do, to create 
    the ability to disrupt ourselves.

## 0.2. Cultural Traits for Footballers with an Identity
**Football** is a *spatial evolutionary game* in the center of our enterprise culture. A *synergistic environment with ethical
standard* are relevant traits that must characterize the **style or identity** of our synergons - aFICS talents - and aFICS
teams.

**Synergy** or '*cooperative willingly under compromise*' trait can survive the intense competition during a game and a 
tournament.  If the spatial distribution allows to cooperators to interact with each other frequently, the *benefits of
cooperation will outweight the losses due to explotation by selfish players*. However, for a synergistic behaviour to get
established in an aFICS team,
- it need  to be found initially in a sufficiently *large cluster* to allow a *high frequency of intra-cooperator interactions*. 
- At the same time, a *tit-for-tat policy* is used as ethical standard to penalize selfish defectors players. 

This two criteria explain 'how the evolution of an aFICS team overcomes the emergence problem of collective and coherent
cooperation'. We assure those specific environmental conditions as a **silent culture of synergy and its reinforcement**. It
tolerates the recurrent presence of a neutral behavior of selfish players that does not harm or does improve the performance
of the aFICS team immerse in the synergistic stress of our cultural environment with its ethical standard.

A third trait is that football is modeled as a *CHASS complex, hierarchical, adaptive social system* [BarYam-2016]. A system has a fixed fine scale dynamics. We are interested in the larger scale of information where the scale of description is similar to the scale of interactions. So, we can also consider the larger scale impacts of the environment of the system and reciprocally.

## 0.3. Certainty and Uncertainty Sources in Local and Global Regions in Football
To understand complex behavior is best described across scales. A football game has two main **local-phases** in its dynamics whose source is *ball control* in local regions and two main **global-phases** whose source is *pitch control* of the global landscape. The local phases are more prone to *fluctuations* than the global phases. 

A football team exhibits 1-out-of-2 playing modes: **on-ball** control and **off-ball** control of local regions. Therefore, two **local phase transitions**, with respect to ball-control, from one local mode to the other, and viceversa: **on-to-off-possession** and **off-to-on-possession** of one or more local regions. Similarly, there are two **global phase transitions** associated to pitch-control. One from **on-to-off-domain** and the othre from **off-to-on-domain** of the pitch or bounded global landscape. All kinds of phase transitions are subject to fluctuations in superiority and control around **critical points** where the transition happens.

Even in the mesoscopic scale, in all local regions and in the global landscape where a specific phase transition is happening, a **patchiness** phenomenon occurs. A subdivision of the space in terms of **superiority** or **control**. A first approach is to *subdivide in **patches** the global landscape* in order to create an alter playground **aPlayground** of reference oriented to cognitive, affordances perception, speedy decision-making for the footballer. Those patches of the playground are our 'relevant' parameter in terms of *superiority and inferiority densities* with respect to the opponent team.

All fluctuations in ball-control and pitch-control, specially those near critical points where transitions happen, are the main sources of uncertainty of the football game. The most important fluctuations are associated to effectiveness of final actions that defines to score or concede a goal. 

## 0.4. Complexity Profile of Football
A *representation* is a map -of the set of possible states- of a system onto -the possible states of- mathematical variables.
We have to focus attention to those states that are *distinguishable* at our mesoscale of observation. We need to identify relevant information at this scale of observation. The **complexity profile** of football is tha amount of information necessary to represent the system as a function of scale. It is given by the number of possible states of the system at this particular scale. We will start with the largest **scale pattern of behavior** and add additional information only as needed.

We are interested in **pattern formation** in football dynamics that represent *universal classes of behavior*. Our core of study are the set of *pattern formation* and *universal classes of behavior* in our AcEmC teams that make connection with those behaviors associated to the greatest teams of football today. 

These ideas summarizes how and where the **synergistic, cognitive and intelligent dimensions of our alter football** are used to develop and evolve our aFICS synergons and aFICS teams at Academia Emeritense FC.

## 0.5. aFICS Blog: A tool at hand to expose my based on science mindset perspective
In the blog, I explore how is that we can all live in the same Football universe yet see reality so differently. I will adopt
science's mindset to walk through in this phenomenon with an aFICS vision. 

Physics and mathematics will be used to determine fundamental concepts about the pitch and the game, although **truth** is not
enterely clear-cut.     

Neuroscience indicates that our perceptions are not direct representations of the external world. Rather each unique brain
makes guesses about reality based on the sensory signals every one receives. 

The uncertainty in space-time about the horizon of ordered events in the world of a football game must be **reduced by
understanding** how we instinctively deal with unknowns and how every one exploit his knowledge about the information 
ecosystem. There is no other way in this multi-perspectivism about football than **build consensus and mutual understanding
about the football game**. 

I offered to Academia Emeritense FC mine in order to institutionalize our vision, mision and proactive actions about aFICS
Football. After that, we can offered it to the world of football everywhere.
